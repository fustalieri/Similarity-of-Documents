# Similarity of Documents : Implementation with Python and Spark

The dataset is the **20Newsgroups**.
The 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets: one for training(or development) and the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation).
The split between the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before and after a specific date.

Steps of the analysis
- transform texts in vectors
- calculate the cosine similarity among the documents
- calculate the cosine similarity among the categories of the documents
- statistical analysis of the previous results
